# Refactoring-challenge-1-UofM
In this Challenge we were given code for a webpage with elements that did not properly work or were not commented on properly. Our task was to go over the HTML and CSS and apply necessary changes to insure they both worked properly, and followed proper semantic structure.
After refactoring the code and applying changes the webpage worked as instructed and looked up to snuff. Once all was fixed we had to make sure the repo worked and looked good and than had to deploy a github webpage.
