# First challenge in UofM bootcamp

In this repo we will be trying to refactor a webpage to follow accessibility standards so that the webpage is optimized for search engines. This webpage will show us proper basic elements of HTML and CSS such that we can acess source code, view semantic HTML elements, find logical structure in styling and positioning, and grading staff can find proper attributes as necessary.
